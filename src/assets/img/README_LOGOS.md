Logo concepts added:

- logo-concept-1.svg — Monogram 'H' inside rounded square with violet→blue gradient. Use as primary mark for headers or favicons. Scalable SVG, transparent outside rounded square.

- logo-concept-2.svg — Abstract hexagonal mark with an 'H' suggestion in white strokes over a subtle gradient. Minimal, good for app icons or badges.

Usage:
- Place files in `src/assets/img/` and import in `Header.jsx` or other components:

  import Logo1 from "../assets/img/logo-concept-1.svg";

- Replace existing logo import or use conditionally for dark/light.

If you want PNG exports, different sizes (48/96/192/512), or tweaks (rounded vs square, text lockup), tell me which variations and preferred colors or initials.
